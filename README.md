# Handwriting-Recognition
This project focuses on developing a robust handwriting recognition system utilizing deep learning techniques. The primary objective is to accurately convert handwritten text into digital text, enhancing the efficiency of data entry and document digitization processes.

The MNIST dataset is accessible from the Keras API, while the A-Z data will be loaded from the disk. Then let’s split the A-Z data into train and test sets. We’ll keep the same test/train data ratio of the MNIST dataset. Then we’ll relabel MNIST to be consistent with AZ, and merge the two datasets. An image generator that will feed the data to the training set of the model is built. Since we are fitting a very simple dataset, we’ll use some data augmentation techniques to help the model generalize better in out-of-sample data. The image generator will perform the augmentation for us, we just specify the ranges of rotation, shift, zoom and shear. Now let’s fit the model. Let’s load the trained neural network. Now let’s load the image we want to test our model on.
